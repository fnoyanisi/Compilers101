# Compilers101
Some notes and self-study material about compilers

## Programs
You will find several small programs written in different languages to practice the theory behind compilers. Some of these programs may be far from complete, but rather written to demonstrate a concept used in compiler construction. Having said that, feel free to send your PRs wherever you find appropriate.

Below is the list of programs in this repository along with a short description.

* ### calc
Simple arithmetic calculator written to practice lexers and parsers.

## Reading
Some good reading material on the subject. 

* [Scott Gordon's lecture notes on _Computing Theory and Programming Languages_](https://athena.ecs.csus.edu/~gordonvs/135/resources/). I found this one very concise and easy to follow. The [_calc_](https://github.com/fnoyanisi/Compilers101/tree/master/calc) program in this repository is implemented based on the information in these lecture notes.

* [Jordan Rose's blog post about being a _compiler wizard_](http://belkadan.com/blog/2016/05/So-You-Want-To-Be-A-Compiler-Wizard/). Some useful advise from a former Compiler Engineer.
