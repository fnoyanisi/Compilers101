# Compilers101
Some notes and self-study material about compilers


## Reading
Some good reading material on the subject. 

* [Scott Gordon's lecture notes on _Computing Theory and Programming Languages_](https://athena.ecs.csus.edu/~gordonvs/135/resources/). I found this one very concise and easy to follow. The [_calc_](https://github.com/fnoyanisi/Compilers101/tree/master/calc) program in this repository is implemented based on the information in these lecture notes.

* [Jordan Rose's blog post about being a _compiler wizard_](http://belkadan.com/blog/2016/05/So-You-Want-To-Be-A-Compiler-Wizard/). Some useful advise from an former Compiler Engineer.
